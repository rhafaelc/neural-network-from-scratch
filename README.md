# Neural Network From Scratch

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for implementing a neural network from scratch. The network is evaluated using the [Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset).

## Features

- **Forward Propagation:** Standard implementation for the forward pass through the network.
- **Backward Propagation:** Utilizes the chain rule for backpropagation.
- **Gradient Descent:** Supports Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, and Batch Gradient Descent.
- **Loss Functions:** Implements Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for regression tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Open and run the notebook to train and evaluate the neural network on the housing prices dataset.
